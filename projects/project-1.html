                <p>A React project based project using a foodie API allowing me to retrieve data and display a recipe based off the search term</p>
                <p>Other than a "Hello World" app this was my first try at a functioning React Application. The basic scope of the project was to retrieve external data from an API source and output onto  the page when required. To do this I used an API from Edamame.com which had excellent documentation as how to query data. First set up a general template to input and display text. Then create a recipe component to hold all the data coming from the API. Using an Async function perform API call and fetch data. State was managed using React hooks which took some time to understand. I liked how the state and method are easily identifiable though.</p>

                <p>Now Recipe component displaying data sent from App.js  through props. I found deconstructuring the props made for less and cleaner code. Within the recipe component I then return a div and ul  listing  the title, ingredients, calories and an image. Returning to App.js the recipes are now displayed by mapping over the recipes array and returning Recipe </p>
                
                <p>Lastly I learned several ways of styling such as inline and style variables but found the module method to be most practical for me. Allowing each component to have its own css file and writing css as I normally would. Using imported fonts and a general card layout I came up with a simple and modern design.</p>
